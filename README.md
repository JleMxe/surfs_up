Salient points regarding the statistics:

- The average temperatures are similar in both months and warm enough that ice cream would be a viable treat.
- The standard deviation of both months is minimal at approximately 3.5°F indicating the months are relatively consistent.
- The sample size being above 1500 samples for both months indicate a good population of data was used in the analysis

# Summary
To summarize, the temperature in Ohau during June and December remains moderate, consistent and reliable enough to support a surf/ice cream shop. However, the analysis could benefit from two more approaches to the data. 
- The first would be a frequency distribution of the temperatures across each month in question, but from the most active weather station to ensure the results aren't muddied by elevation differences and location effects.

    -The results of those queries, when plotted, look like the graphs below. They indicate that the bulk of the sample data for both months is predominately above 70°F making most of the month amenable to ice cream as a treat.

- The second would be frequency distribution for rain fall also from the most active weather station. 

    -The resulting charts below indicate that the bulk of the samples indicate the precipitation is generally very near zero.
